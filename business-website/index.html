                <h1>Shampoo</h1>
                <p>
                    While washing your hair, it may be tempting to get rid of grime by tackling it head-on, but be careful not to press or dig your nails into the scalp harshly.
                    We know, it sounds so basic since washing your hair can feel like second nature. As tempting as it can be to keep things moving and rinse out the hair quickly, the truth is that taking the extra time to properly cleanse your hair can be worth it in the long run.
                    To keep your hair looking its best, consider rethinking how you wash your hair with these 4 helpful tips.

                <h1>Conditioner</h1>
                <p>
                    First of all, you shouldn't be applying your conditioner when your hair is dry. Instead, you can apply it either before or after shampooing.
                    Pour a small quantity of conditioner into the palm of your hand, rub your hands together and smooth the conditioner over your hair, paying particular attention to the older, more weathered ends.
                    To avoid weighing your hair down, do not rub conditioner into your scalp or to the hair near your scalp

                <h1>Hair Mask</h1>
                <p>
                    Always use the treatment after shampooing. Using shampoo first will break down any build up in the hair, allowing the mask to focus on the areas that need the extra love.
                    Shampooing causes the hair follicles to open up, so slathering the mask immediately after your wash will really help the conditioning ingredients to go through.
                    Leave it on for three to 20 minutes and rinse it off. "Limit masking to once a week", adds Tsapatori.
