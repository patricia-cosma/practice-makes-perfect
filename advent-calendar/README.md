Choosing the idea for this project was so easy. I wanted to learn and apply CSS and JavaScript, but also make something a bit more personal than the projects before. Designing the Advent Calendar and making it responsive was quite the trick. I found it harder to put JavaScript in place, but after research and "what is going on here?", I made it work!

It's never too early for preparing your Advent Calendar, isn't it?

The button is functionable. After clicking 'Create Calendar', the lines and the number according to each door will show up.
After that, clicking any door is possible.
